This is a non-optimized, extremely quick
build of a neural cellular automata
made in an afternoon by me. Run on cpu, not gpu :(

Please use at your own risk as some patterns and parameter changes can result in
very strong flashing lights, so please use at your own discretion,
especially those of which who are photosensitive.

Thank you!

DEPENDENCIES:
SDL2
